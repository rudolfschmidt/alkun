# alkun
Alkun was created because of a lot of frustration about the spring boot project.

Spring is a great project but faces performance and usability issues. The issues come from a complex code structure that has grown historically. Because of a lot of nested objects and functions the performance is bad and also its hard to maintain. Because of that complex structure even for the project maintainer its hard to find proper solutions for annoying bugs like https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/5834

Software need to be easy, simple and most important, maintainable! Alkun doesn only what is supposed to be. It translates http commands to an java interface. Not less and not more.
